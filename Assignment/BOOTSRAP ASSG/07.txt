â€¢ How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?

=>Bootstrap provides a simple way to create thumbnails using its grid system and predefined classes. 
To make thumbnails, you can utilize the img-thumbnail class along with the grid system to structure and style the thumbnails. First, define a grid layout using rows and columns.
Then, place images inside div elements with the col classes to control their size and alignment. Apply the img-thumbnail class to each image to add borders and padding, creating a uniform thumbnail appearance.
By combining these Bootstrap components and classes, you can efficiently generate visually appealing thumbnails for your website or application.
