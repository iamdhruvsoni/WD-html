=>Containers are the most basic layout element in bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
Choose from a responsive,fixed-width container or fluid-width(meaning it's 100% wide all the time).

  for ex :-1)container

<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>

2)Container-fluid


<div class="container-fluid">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
