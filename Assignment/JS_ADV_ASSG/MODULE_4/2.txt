Q-2 What is Promises?

=>The Promise object represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its
  resulting value.

-A Promise is in one of these states:

1)Pending: intial state,neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2)fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
3)rejected: meaning that the operation failed.


syntax is as follows.

->>  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
     //Block of code.
});

promise can be consumed by regestering functions using .then and .catch method.

1).then method= This method is invoked when a promise is either resolved or rejected.It may also be defined as a 
   carrier that takes data from promise and further executes it successfully.

2).catch method= This method is invoked when a promise is either rejected or some error has occured in execution.
  It is used as Error handler whenever at any step there is a chance of getting an error.
